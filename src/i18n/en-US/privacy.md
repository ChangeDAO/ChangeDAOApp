We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

- **Tracking Technologies.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent; however, due to the varying practices of organizations that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we generally do not respond to do not track (“DNT”) signals sent via browsers at this time.
