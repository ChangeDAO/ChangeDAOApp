# Change DAO Terms of Use

Last Modified: June 17, 2022

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Acceptance of the Terms of Use</span>**

These terms of use are entered into by and between You, whether as a guest or registered user, and **ChangeDAO LLC** ("**Company**," “**ChangeDAO**,” "**we**," or "**us**"). The following terms and conditions ("**Terms of Use**") govern your access to and use of ChangeDAO.org (the **“Website”**), including any content, functionality, tools, features and services provided in connection with our services, including without limitation, using our services to view, explore, and create NFTs and use our tools, at your own discretion, to connect with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the **“Service”**). For purposes of these Terms of Use, “NFT” means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain) which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.

Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Service. **By using the Service, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, found at [changedao.org/privacy](/privacy), incorporated herein by reference.** If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Service.

The Company and the Service is based in the United States of America (USA) and offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company under the laws of the State of Washington, USA. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Service.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature of the Service</span>**

ChangeDAO is the NFT marketplace for change. Web3 Social Impact, Crypto philanthropy and direct donations to nonprofits and social causes is an emerging and expanding marketplace in comparison with the marketplace for fine art and collectables. ChangeDAO bridges the gap between the two by providing a decentralized Web3 (world wide web based on blockchain) platform that helps users interact with each other and NFTs created and made available by approved Changemakers through the Service. Changemakers seeking an invitation to create and list works for sale as NFTs through the Service must submit a request for approval. ChangeDAO has unilateral discretion in granting and revoking approval to Changemakers to use the Service based on ChangeDAO’s view on Changemakers best suited to the platform and the mission and values of ChangeDAO. All Changemakers are subject to these Terms of Use.

ChangeDAO does not have or maintain custody or control over the NFTs or the blockchains on which they are implemented. ChangeDAO does not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs and has no control over these payments or transactions nor the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. ChangeDAO is not a custodian, wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor.

The Service relies on third-party wallets and other third-party service providers, including public blockchains. In order to use the Service, You must use a third-party wallet which allows you to make transactions on blockchains. These wallets and third-party service providers may require the payment of transaction fees and You are solely responsible for such payment. Such fees are in addition to fees charged by ChangeDAO as described herein.

To initiate transactions in NFTs, users must voluntarily invoke smart contracts. You acknowledge that all fees, commissions and royalties are transferred, processed or initiated by the applicable smart contract and You hereby consent to and agree to be bound by the distribution of all fees, commissions and royalties by the applicable smart contracts. Changemakers that choose to create smart contracts with ChangeDAO Services are required to use ChangeDAO’s royalty smart contracts on secondary marketplaces such as Opensea, Lookrare, Coinbase NFT, and all similar.

**ChangeDAO is not party to any agreement between any users and ChangeDAO disclaims all liability for any transactions that You make through the Service regardless of the nature, whether involving NFTs or interacting with other users. You assume all risk regarding any purchases, transactions or interactions with other users through the Service. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ChangeDAO has a strict NO REFUND policy</span>. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service. Additionally, ChangeDAO makes no claims about the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of charitable organizations and causes associated with the Service and the tax deductibility of any funds that you may direct to such organizations or causes. ChangeDAO does not provide evidence of charitable contributions and You should contact such organizations for all receipts and evidence of contributions that you may require. **

ChangeDAO collects platform fees in connection with the Service and are available here:

[https://docs.changedao.org/about-us/marketplace-fees](https://docs.changedao.org/about-us/marketplace-fees)

These fees may change from time to time, and we reserve the right to charge additional fees for the Service upon posting such changes to these Terms of Service.

In addition, on checkout, you have the opportunity to provide a tip directly to ChangeDAO if you so choose.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Additional Terms; Changes to the Terms of Use; Changes to the Service / Availability</span>**

Because of the growing and evolving nature of ChangeDAO, We may need to provide additional terms for specific services or features of the Service (and such services or features are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms of Use). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service or feature, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services or features. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service or feature, such additional terms shall control for that specific service or feature. We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Service thereafter.

Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check the Terms of Use each time you access the Service so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Service, and any service, features or material we provide in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users. This may include: removing the ability to view certain NFTs on the Service or use our Service to interact with the NFTs; disabling the ability to use the Service in conjunction with buying/selling/transferring NFTs available on blockchains; disabling your ability to access our Service; and/or other actions.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Accessing the Service </span>**

You are responsible for both:

- Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Service.
- Ensuring that all persons who access the Service through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

To access the Service or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Service that all the information you provide is correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with the Service or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features, is governed by our _[Privacy Policy](/privacy)_, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

Your blockchain address functions as your identity on ChangeDAO. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the Service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, ChangeDAO may provide you with the ability to customize your persona via establishing your profile where you may choose to create a username and password, profile picture, background image, and other characteristics to your Account. By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with ChangeDAO, and ChangeDAO does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. ChangeDAO accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. You are solely responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Service or your Account.

You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any user Account at any time in our sole discretion if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from ChangeDAO (e.g., via email, push notification, text messages, or other types of messages). These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g., transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. We may also send you promotional communications via electronic communications we think will be of interest to you. You understand that you are not required to provide this consent as a condition of using the Service and you may opt out of these communications through the Service by following the unsubscribe instructions provided.

All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Use.

Any User Contribution you post to the site will be considered non-confidential and, with the exception of NFTs, non-proprietary. By providing any User Contribution to the Service, you grant ChangeDAO, our affiliates and service providers, and each of their respective licensees, successors, and assigns the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for current and future business purposes, including, to provide, promote and improve the Service. This includes, without limitation, any digital file, art, or other material linked to or associated with any NFTs that are displayed on the Service.

You represent and warrant that:

- You own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns.
- All of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms of Use.

You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or contribute, and you, not the Company, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Third-Party Content and Services / Links</span>**

We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Service.

ChangeDAO does not make any representations or warranties about this third-party content visible through our Service, including any content associated with NFTs displayed on the Service, and you bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers. We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on the Service will always remain visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred.

NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated with a given NFT, including any terms specified in the applicable smart contract (“Purchase Terms”). ChangeDAO is not a party to any such Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and the seller. The buyer and seller are entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase Terms. You are solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase Terms. Your license, if any, in any content linked to or associated with any NFTs is solely as set forth by the applicable seller or creator of such NFT. Changemakers and users acknowledge that by minting a NFT on the Service, ChangeDAO is granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, assignable, sublicensable, perpetual, royalty-free license to display the NFT (or allow third parties to do so) for purposes of promoting the Service and other related purposes without the permission, mention of, or credit given to, the NFT creator, owner seller or purchaser.

ChangeDAO **does not** provide Ether to Changemakers or swap or provide any sort of cryptocurrency exchange services. ChangeDAO does not custody assets, passthrough or provide financial services of any kind. ChangeDAO does not review smart contracts. Smart contracts minted on the ethereum blockchain are **permanent**, **immutable** and **decentralized**. Neither ChangeDAO, nor the Changemaker, have the ability to 'take-down' or remove a smart contract from the ethereum blockchain.

The Service may also contain links or functionality to access or use third-party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display, include, or make available content, data, information, services, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”). When you click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of that website or destination. ChangeDAO is not responsible for providing You a warning when You click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, that you have left our Service. Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials are not under the control of ChangeDAO, and may be “open” applications for which no recourse is possible. ChangeDAO is not responsible or liable for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials. ChangeDAO provides links to these Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Applications, or their products or services or associated Third-Party Materials. We have no control over and accept no responsibility for Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials. Your use of all links in Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials is at your own risk and subject to their applicable terms and conditions.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination</span>**

We have the right to:

- Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason in our sole discretion.
- Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or could create liability for the Company.
- Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.
- Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Service.

YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMPANY/ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER THE COMPANY/SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

However, we do not review all material before it is posted on the Service, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Content Standards</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reliance on Information Posted</span>**

The information presented on or through the Service is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Service or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

The Service may include content provided by third parties, including materials provided by other users, bloggers, and third-party licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services. All statements and/or opinions expressed in these materials, and all articles and responses to questions and other content, other than the content provided by the Company, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing those materials. These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Company. We are not responsible, or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Assumption of Risk</span>**

By using the Service, you accept and acknowledge:

- The value of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.
- A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
- The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.
- You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions. ChangeDAO is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your NFTs or the tax deductibility of any transactions. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL CHANGEDAO BE DEEMED TO BE PROVIDING TAX ADVICE.
- There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become nontransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
- We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and ChangeDAO has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
- There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that ChangeDAO will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.
- The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
- ChangeDAO reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on ChangeDAO. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on ChangeDAO or an inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against ChangeDAO.
- If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.
